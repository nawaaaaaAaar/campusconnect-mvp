# CampusConnect Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ User Names Showing as "Unknown" or "Anonymous"

**Problem:** Users without a `name` set in their profile were showing as "Unknown" or "Anonymous" in the UI.

**Solution:**
- Updated `HomeFeed.tsx` to show the username portion of email (before @) when name is NULL
- Example: `john.doe@iitj.ac.in` → displays as `john.doe` instead of "Anonymous"
- Updated backend APIs to include both `name` and `email` in profile data:
  - `home-feed-api`: Now includes `profiles(id,name,email,avatar_url)` in post queries
  - `posts-api`: Now includes `profiles(id,name,email,avatar_url)` in comments queries

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Before
{comment.profiles?.name || 'Anonymous'}

// After
{comment.profiles?.name || (comment.profiles?.email ? comment.profiles.email.split('@')[0] : 'User')}
```

### 2. ✅ Only Verified Societies Should Be Visible in Discovery

**Problem:** All societies (including unverified/pending ones) were showing in discovery and search.

**Solution:**
- Modified `societies-api` to filter by `verified=true` by default
- Only shows verified societies in discovery unless explicitly queried otherwise
- Admins can still see all societies by passing `verified=false` query parameter

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Default to verified societies only in discovery
if (verified !== null && verified !== undefined) {
    filters.push(`verified.eq.${verified}`);
} else {
    filters.push(`verified.eq.true`); // PRD: Default to verified only
}
```

### 3. ✅ Only Verified Societies Should Be Able to Post

**Problem:** Unverified societies could create posts, leading to spam and unapproved content.

**Solution:**

#### Backend Validation (Critical)
- Added verification check in `posts-api` POST endpoint
- Returns `403 SOCIETY_NOT_VERIFIED` error if society is not verified
- Error message: "Your society must be verified before you can create posts. Please wait for admin approval."

#### Feed Filtering
- Updated `home-feed-api` to only fetch posts from verified societies using `societies!inner` join
- Added `&societies.verified=eq.true` filter to both followed and global post queries
- Ensures feed only shows content from approved societies

#### Frontend UI
- Added "Waiting for Approval" warning banner in `PostCreationForm.tsx` for unverified societies
- Shows yellow alert with:
  - Warning icon
  - Society name
  - "Waiting for Approval" heading
  - Message: "Your society is pending verification. You'll be able to create posts once an admin approves your society. This usually takes 24-48 hours."
- Disabled "Create Post" button for unverified societies
- Added error handling for `SOCIETY_NOT_VERIFIED` error

**Code Changes:**

Backend (`posts-api`):
```typescript
// Check if society is verified before allowing post creation
if (!societyData.verified) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({
        error: { 
            code: 'SOCIETY_NOT_VERIFIED', 
            message: 'Your society must be verified before you can create posts. Please wait for admin approval.' 
        }
    }), {
        status: 403,
        headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
}
```

Feed API (`home-feed-api`):
```typescript
// Only show posts from verified societies
let query = `...societies!inner(id,name,verified,category,institute_id,logo_url)...`;
query += `&societies.verified=eq.true`;
```

Frontend (`PostCreationForm.tsx`):
```tsx
{!isVerified && selectedSociety && (
  <div className="mb-6 p-4 bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-lg">
    <h4>Waiting for Approval</h4>
    <p>Your society <strong>{selectedSociety.name}</strong> is pending verification...</p>
  </div>
)}

<Button 
  type="submit" 
  disabled={isSubmitting || isUploading || !isVerified}
>
```

## Testing Checklist

### User Names
- [ ] Check that users with NULL names show username from email (not "Anonymous")
- [ ] Verify comments show proper author names
- [ ] Test with various email formats

### Verified Societies
- [ ] Verify discovery only shows verified societies
- [ ] Test that unverified societies cannot create posts
- [ ] Check that "Waiting for Approval" banner appears for unverified societies
- [ ] Verify "Create Post" button is disabled for unverified societies
- [ ] Test that feed only shows posts from verified societies

### Admin Flow
- [ ] Admin can verify societies from `/admin` panel
- [ ] After verification, society can immediately create posts
- [ ] Verified badge appears on society posts

---

## Admin Access

**Your Admin Account:**
- Email: `m25la1010@iitj.ac.in`
- User ID: `1211784b-1a9e-48bc-94e5-55f84b194a31`
- Role: `admin`
- Permissions: Full (manage_users, manage_societies, manage_reports, view_analytics)

**Access Admin Panel:**
1. Navigate to `/admin` in your app
2. You should see the full admin dashboard with:
   - Analytics overview
   - Societies management (verify pending societies here!)
   - Reports queue
   - User management

---

## What Happens Now?

### For Unverified Societies:
1. Society creates an account
2. Society sees "Waiting for Approval" banner
3. Post creation is disabled
4. Society waits for admin verification (24-48 hours typically)

### For Admin (You):
1. Go to `/admin`
2. Click "Societies" tab
3. See pending societies
4. Click "Verify" button to approve
5. Society can now post immediately!

### For Verified Societies:
1. Can create posts freely
2. Posts appear in user feeds
3. Verified badge shows on their posts
4. Appears in discovery/search

---

## Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Existing verified societies continue working normally
- Feed performance improved by filtering at database level
- RLS policies still apply for additional security
