## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens:** Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
- **Refresh Tokens:** Secure, HTTP-only cookies
- **Password Requirements:**
  - Minimum 8 characters
  - Must include: uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
  - Hashed with bcrypt (cost factor: 12)
- **MFA:** Optional two-factor authentication
- **Session Management:** Automatic logout after 24 hours

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest:** AES-256 for sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit:** TLS 1.3 minimum
- **Database:** Row-level security (RLS) enabled
- **Backups:** Encrypted and stored securely
- **PII Handling:** Minimal collection, encrypted storage

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting:**
  - Authentication: 5 requests/15 minutes
  - API calls: 100 requests/minute
  - Admin operations: 20 requests/minute
- **CORS:** Whitelist-based origins
- **Input Validation:** All inputs sanitized and validated
- **Output Encoding:** XSS prevention
- **SQL Injection:** Parameterized queries only

### Network Security

- **CSP Headers:** Strict Content Security Policy
- **HSTS:** HTTP Strict Transport Security enabled
- **X-Frame-Options:** DENY
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** nosniff
- **Referrer-Policy:** strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Infrastructure

- **Hosting:** Vercel (SOC 2 Type II compliant)
- **Database:** Supabase (ISO 27001 certified)
- **CDN:** Cloudflare (WAF enabled)
- **Monitoring:** Sentry for error tracking
- **Logging:** Audit logs for all sensitive operations

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**
   ```bash
   # Use .env files (gitignored)
   cp env.example .env
   ```

2. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

3. **Run security checks**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   npm run test
   ```

4. **Use environment variables**
   ```typescript
   // ✅ Good
   const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_API_KEY
   
   // ❌ Bad
   const apiKey = 'hardcoded-key-123'
   ```

5. **Validate all inputs**
   ```typescript
   import { validateEmail, sanitizeHtml } from '@/lib/validation'
   
   const result = validateEmail(userInput)
   if (!result.valid) {
     throw new Error(result.error)
   }
   ```

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords**
   - At least 12 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - Use a password manager

2. **Enable 2FA** (when available)

3. **Keep your account secure**
   - Don't share credentials
   - Log out from shared devices
   - Review session activity regularly

4. **Be cautious of phishing**
   - Verify URLs before clicking
   - Don't enter credentials on suspicious sites
   - Report suspicious emails

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Internal Audits

- **Code Reviews:** All PRs require security review
- **Automated Scanning:** GitHub Dependabot, Snyk
- **Penetration Testing:** Quarterly internal testing

### External Audits

- **Bug Bounty Program:** (Coming soon)
- **Third-party Audits:** Annual security assessment
- **Compliance:** GDPR, CCPA compliant
