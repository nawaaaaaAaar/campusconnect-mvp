# 🎯 FINAL FIX - RLS Token Authentication Issue

**Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED & DEPLOYED**

---

## 🔴 **The Problem**

After deploying all Edge Functions, the app was still throwing **500 Internal Server Errors** on critical endpoints:

```
❌ POST /posts-api/{id}/like → 500 Error
❌ POST /posts-api/{id}/comments → 500 Error  
❌ DELETE /posts-api/{id}/like → 500 Error
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Investigation Steps:**

1. **Checked tables exist:** ✅ `post_likes`, `post_comments`, `posts` all exist
2. **Checked RLS policies:** ✅ Policies exist and enabled
3. **Identified the bug:** ❌ Service role key being used for RLS-protected operations

### **The Technical Issue:**

**RLS Policies check `auth.uid()`:**
```sql
-- post_likes INSERT policy
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id)

-- post_comments INSERT policy  
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = author_id)
```

**Edge Function was using service role key:**
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - auth.uid() is NULL with service role key
const likeResponse = await fetch(`${supabaseUrl}/rest/v1/post_likes`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${serviceRoleKey}`, // ❌ No auth.uid()
    'apikey': serviceRoleKey
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ user_id: userId, post_id: postId })
})
```

**Result:** RLS policies block the operation because `auth.uid()` is NULL → **500 Error**

---

## ✅ **The Solution**

### **Use User's JWT Token for RLS Operations:**

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Store user's token
let userToken = null
if (authHeader) {
  userToken = authHeader.replace('Bearer ', '')
  // ... verify user ...
}

// ✅ Use userToken for RLS-protected operations
const likeResponse = await fetch(`${supabaseUrl}/rest/v1/post_likes`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}`, // ✅ Has auth.uid()
    'apikey': serviceRoleKey
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ user_id: userId, post_id: postId })
})
```

### **Operations Fixed:**

| Operation | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Create like | ❌ 500 Error | ✅ Uses `userToken` |
| Delete like | ❌ 500 Error | ✅ Uses `userToken` |
| Check existing like | ❌ 500 Error | ✅ Uses `userToken` |
| Create comment | ❌ 500 Error | ✅ Uses `userToken` |

### **Operations Still Using Service Role (Correct):**

- ✅ Admin operations (need to bypass RLS)
- ✅ Reading posts/profiles (no RLS restrictions)
- ✅ Audit logging (privileged operation)
- ✅ Post creation (societies table has different RLS)
- ✅ Post editing/deletion (verification checks, not RLS)

## 🧪 **How to Verify the Fix**

### **Test in Your App:**

1. **Like a Post**
   - Click the heart icon on any post
   - ✅ **Expected:** Like count increases, heart fills, NO 500 error
   - ❌ **Before:** 500 Internal Server Error

2. **Comment on a Post**
   - Type a comment and click submit
   - ✅ **Expected:** Comment appears in the list, NO 500 error
   - ❌ **Before:** 500 Internal Server Error

3. **Unlike a Post**
   - Click the heart icon again on a liked post
   - ✅ **Expected:** Like count decreases, heart empties, NO 500 error
   - ❌ **Before:** 500 Internal Server Error

### **Check Browser Console:**

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ POST https://.../posts-api/{id}/like 500 (Internal Server Error)
❌ POST https://.../posts-api/{id}/comments 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ POST https://.../posts-api/{id}/like 200 OK
✅ POST https://.../posts-api/{id}/comments 200 OK
```

### **Check Supabase Logs:**

```bash
npx supabase functions logs posts-api
```

**Look for:**
- ✅ `pathSegments: ['{id}', 'like']` (correct path parsing)
- ✅ `200 OK` responses
- ❌ NO `Failed to like post` or `permission denied` errors

## 💡 **Why This Was Difficult to Spot**

1. **Path routing bug masked RLS issue** - Fixed path routing first, but RLS bug remained
2. **Service role key bypasses RLS in some contexts** - But not for INSERT with WITH CHECK
3. **Error messages were generic** - 500 error didn't specify "RLS policy violation"
4. **Multi-layered authentication** - Both service role AND user token needed
5. **Tables existed with policies** - Everything looked correct structurally

---

## 🎓 **Key Learnings**

### **RLS Best Practices:**

1. **Use service role key for:**
   - Admin operations
   - Reading public data
   - Audit logging
   - Operations that should bypass RLS

2. **Use user JWT token for:**
   - User-specific INSERT operations
   - User-specific DELETE operations
   - Any operation where RLS checks `auth.uid()`

3. **Always test RLS policies with actual user tokens**
   - Don't rely on service role key for development testing
   - RLS behavior is different with service role vs user JWT

### **Debugging Edge Functions:**

1. **Check function logs first** - Real-time errors appear here
2. **Verify path parsing** - Log `pathSegments` for debugging
3. **Test RLS policies in SQL Editor** - Verify they work as expected
4. **Check both qual and with_check clauses** - Both can block operations

## 📞 **If Issues Persist**

If you still see 500 errors after this fix:

1. **Hard refresh your browser** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Clear browser cache** or use incognito mode
3. **Check function logs:**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions logs posts-api
   ```
